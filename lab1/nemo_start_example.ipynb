    "compiled executables](https://teuben.github.io/nemo/man_html/index1.html) that run in a Unix environment. Normally you would issue commands in a terminal (shell), or via a script. Parameters are passed to the programs, and data are stored in files or passed via unix pipes.\n",
    "But since NEMO version 4.1.2 there is some better support to use NEMO commands in a jupyter notebook.    There are a few ways to use these into a notebook, with currently a few limitations. Here we are exploring some, but watch out for future changes. For now we are also limited to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When NEMO was installed, the file **nemo_start.py** was also created. This file will need to be locally present, so we can import it, or copied into your python's sys.path, or your site-packages. This is the best way to make sure to inherit the environment in a portable way.\n",
